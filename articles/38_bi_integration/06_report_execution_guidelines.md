# Report Execution Guidelines

BI reports are created and executed using the BI's **Designer** module. 

Generation of a report without opening the BI application can be done by the  **GetExecute** REST API. The [Fabric Jobs mechanism](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/01_fabric_jobs_overview.md) enables generation of BI reports via Fabric user code so they can be scheduled and can benefit from Jobs execution parameters. 

In addition, the report generation can be done typing a direct link to a report in the browsers.

The sections below explain about these options.

### Reports Generation Using the Designer Module

Generate the report in the **Designer** module using the ![run](images/run_icon.PNG) icon in the Report Tree or the Run ![run](images/run_button.PNG) button in the report editor. 

You can setup various report generation options using the Report Options (applicable for Advance Reports) by clicking **Advanced** > **General Options**:

For example, you can define the report behavior when there is no qualified data for a report. It is done by setting the **No Data Qualify Display Mode** argument to one of the following options:

* **Show Message**: 
  * When running a report via the BI's Designer, **No Data Qualified** message is displayed.
  * When a report is generated [via the Fabric Job](06_report_execution_guidelines.md#reports-generation-using-the-fabric-jobs-mechanism), the extract file is not created.
* **Show Report**:
  * When running a report via the BI's Designer, static data of the report (such as column titles) is displayed. 
  * When a report is generated [via the Fabric Job](06_report_execution_guidelines.md#reports-generation-using-the-fabric-jobs-mechanism), the extract file is created and it includes static data only.

### Reports Generation Using the Fabric Jobs Mechanism

Generate the report using the [STARTJOB command](/articles/20_jobs_and_batch_services/07_jobs_commands.md) using the following syntax:

~~~
startjob GENERATE_BI NAME='<name>' [UID='<uid>'] [AFFINITY='<affinity>'] <ARGS='<args>'> [EXEC_INTERVAL='<execInterval>'];
~~~

Set the job parameters as follows:

* Use the **GENERATE_BI** as the job type.

* Set the **NAME** to be the full path from the root folder to the report. In the below example, the NAME is 'Public/Reports/Subsc_List'.

  ![img](images/report_exe_1.PNG)

  * Note that 'My Reports' folder is intended for local work only and is not exposed via the REST API. As a result, the reports defined within 'My Reports' folder cannot be generated by a job.

* Populate all the job input parameters inside the **ARGS** as follows:
  * **OUTPUT_NAME** - extract file name. For example, you can concatenate parameters such as IID or datetime to the original report name or even provide a completely different name for the extract file.
  * **TYPE** - export file format can be one of the following: **csv, excel, pdf, rtf**.
  * **DESTINATION** - the name of the Fabric interface where the export file should be placed. It can be either a Local File System or an SFTP interface type.
  * **SESSION_PARAMS** - array of the session parameters used by the report. Only the **Id** (name) and the **Value** attributes of the parameter are mandatory. The other attributes (such as Type) are optional. 

* The following are optional **ARGS**:

  * **FILTER** (optional) - parameters to filter the report's results. Note that this is a run-time filter and it is <u>not</u> related to the built-in filter which is added as part of report creation (whose value is set using the session parameters). The filter parameters are sent as a JSON object. Only the **FilterText** and the **Values** parameters are required. The **FilterText** should include a data object and a column to filter on. **Operator** is set to 0 (EqualTo) by default.
  * **SORT** (optional) - parameters to sort the report's results. Note that this is a run-time sort and it is <u>not</u> related to the built-in sort which is added as part of report creation. The sort parameters are sent as a JSON object. The fields **EntityName** and **ColumnName** (data object and column to sort on) are required. The **AscendingFlag** is optional and set to false by default.
  * **DATA_SOURCES_LIST** - this is a placeholder, the parameter will be available in future versions.

**Example of GENERATE_BI Job with Session Parameter**

~~~
startjob GENERATE_BI NAME='Public/Reports/Subsc_List' ARGS='{"OUTPUT_NAME":"Subscribers_list_20211101_v120", "TYPE":"csv", "DESTINATION":"MyLocalFS", "SESSION_PARAMS": "[{\"Id\":\"customer_id\", \"Value\":\"120\" }]"}';
~~~

Note that **SESSION_PARAMS** is a mandatory parameter for all reports based on Fabric LU data. Such reports require at least one session parameter definition - to pass the IID of the LU's root table to perform GET INSTANCE command. When the report is based on PostgreSQL or Oracle data source, sending **SESSION_PARAMS** is optional.

**Example of GENERATE_BI Job with a run-time filter** 

~~~
startjob GENERATE_BI name='Public/task_exe_test1' ARGS='{"OUTPUT_NAME":"task_exe_20211101", "TYPE":"csv", "DESTINATION":"LocalListener", "FILTER":"{\"FilterText\":\"TASK_EXECUTION_ENTITIES_9.LU_NAME\", \"Values\":[\"Billing\"] }" }';
~~~

**Example of GENERATE_BI Job with a run-time sort** 

~~~
startjob GENERATE_BI name='ForReporting/Load/TDM_3_4_TEST' ARGS='{"OUTPUT_NAME":"TDM_20211101", "TYPE":"csv", "DESTINATION":"localFileSystem", "SORT":"{\"EntityName\":\"TASK_EXECUTION_ENTITIES_9\",\"ColumnName\":\"TARGET_ENTITY_ID\", \"AscendingFlag\":true}" }';
~~~

### Reports Generation Using Deep Link

Generate the report using a direct link to it in a separate browser, as follows:

~~~
<host>:<port>/app/BI/<report path in BI>
~~~

Where **report path in BI** is the full name of the report from the Root folder till the report name.

For example, the deep link to the report **mig_rep** under the folder **test_designer** running on a **localhost** is: 

http://localhost:3213/app/BI/test_designer/mig_rep
