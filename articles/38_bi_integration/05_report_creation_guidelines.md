# Report Creation Guidelines

### Overview

This article describes several important guidelines for creating reports with the BI application. It requires working with both the **Admin** module, and the **Designer** module of BI, and as such, can only be carried out by users with BI_ADMIN privileges.

### Creating Reports Based on Fabric LU Tables

One of the basic reports is a report based on data from a Fabric LU Instance. Follow these steps to create such report:

1. Open the **Admin** module (click on the Admin tab in the upper left) to do these tasks:

   * Create the Fabric data source and define its objects and joins, as explained step-by-step in the [Metadata Setup](03_Metadata_Setup.md) article. 
   * Create the parameter(s) to be used by the filter, as explained in the [Parameters](04_parameters.md) article.
2. Open the **Fabric Studio** and define the Interfaces with the same name as the data sources that you created in the Admin module. 
3. Open the **Designer** module (click on the Designer tab in the upper left).  
4. Click the ![image](images/create_icon.PNG) icon to trigger creation of a new report.
5. Select the report type. For example **Advanced Report**. 
6. Select the data objects for the report. Note the following:
   * The list of data objects presents a list of all existing data objects under all defined data sources. 
   * Once the first data object is selected, most of the objects are disabled except for those that have a join with the selected object.
   * Start the selection from the LU Root table and down to the required tables, based on the LU Schema relations. 
7. Once the data objects are selected, click the![image](images/filter_icon.PNG) icon to set the filter by IID as follows:

8. Once the filter is set, click **Okay**. 

### Creating Reports Based on Fabric Custom SQL

Sometimes the report data requires writing a complex SQL query rather then just selecting columns from several joined tables. This is supported by a Customer SQL Object screen.

Creating a report based on a query executed on a Fabric LUI is similar to creating it based on Fabric LUI tables.  Click the ![image](images/create_icon.PNG) icon to trigger the new report creation and then instead of selecting the data objects, click the![image](images/add_sql_icon.PNG)icon to write the custom query using the Custom SQL Object screen:

Since this SQL is executed on an LUI, it must also include a filter by LU Instance ID. For example:

~~~sql
SELECT TE.source_id, TE.target_id, tasks.be_name, task_execution.task_execution_id, 'Copied' as status
FROM (select distinct entity_id as source_id, target_entity_id as target_id
		from task_execution_link_entities
		where parent_entity_id = '' and execution_status = 'completed'
		except
	  select entity_id as source_id, target_entity_id as target_id
		from task_execution_link_entities
		where parent_entity_id = '' and execution_status <> 'completed') TE, tasks, task_execution
WHERE task_execution.task_execution_id = '@task_execution_id@'
~~~

The IID value can be provided using a parameter which is created in the **Admin** module and set either in **Admin** or programmatically via the REST API call. See more at [Reports execution guidelines](06_report_execution_guidelines.md). 

### Creating Reports Based on Fabric Commands

When you need to create a report based on the Fabric Command results, it can be done using the Custom SQL Object screen. 

Click the ![image](images/create_icon.PNG) icon to trigger the new report creation and then instead of selecting the data objects, click the![image](images/add_sql_icon.PNG)icon to write the custom query using the Custom SQL Object screen. Use the syntax as shown below:

~~~sql
select * from k2_fabric_command_sql where command='<command>'
~~~

**Example of a report of Fabric command without parameters:**

~~~sql
select * from k2_fabric_command_sql where command='test_connection'
~~~

**Example of a report of Fabric command with parameters:**

~~~sql
select * from k2_fabric_command_sql where command='batch_list status="@status_name@";'
~~~

Where **status_name** is a session parameter.
