# Installation and Configuration

The installation and configuration of Fabric's BI includes the following steps:

- [Installation](01_Installation.md#installation) - Fabric's BI is based on ExagoBI, so you must install the ExagoBI server and the Storage Management DB.
- [Configuration](01_Installation.md#configuration) - Configure parameters in the Fabric config.ini file.
- [Project Initialization with BI](01_Installation.md#Project-Initialization-in-BI). 

### Installation

* Install **the latest available Exago version** using the [ExagoBI Installation document](/articles/98_maintenance_and_operational/BI_Installation/01_ExagoBI_Installation.md).
* Install the **Storage Management DB** - the database that keeps the report definition, which includes the report type and metadata, currency, decimal setting, fonts, colors and more. The following types are supported:
  * **SQLite** (default), doesn't require an installation since it comes with the ExagoBI installation.
  * **PostgreSQL**, must be installed.

**Installation Recommendations**

- Have 3 separate BI installations - one each for Dev, QA and Production environments.

  - Linux installation is required for UAT / Production environments.
  - Installation on Windows (as a docker) can be done for development or demo purposes.

- The recommended Storage Management DB type is PostgreSQL.

  - PostgreSQL is required for UAT / Production environments, but it is preferable to use PostgreSQL for Dev and QA as well.
  - Default SQLite DB can be used for demo purposes. SQLite DB does not require an explicite installation as it comes as part of the Exago installation.
- Due to performance considerations, it is recommended to install the PostgreSQL on a different host than Exago.

### Configuration

The BI solution uses the Fabric **config.ini** to retrieve information about the BI host and port and the Storage Management DB connection details.

Update the **[bi]** section parameters of the Fabric **config.ini** as follows:

* **BI_HOST**, the IP address of the Fabric BI server.
* **STORAGE_MGMT_HOST**, the IP address of the Storage Management DB. Empty for SQLite DB.
* **BI_PORT**, the listener port for the Storage Management DB. The default is 5432.
* **STORAGE_MGMT_DB_NAME**, the name of the Storage Management DB. The default is StorageMgmt.
* **STORAGE_MGMT_DB_TYPE**, the type of Storage Management DB. The default is SQLite. The recommended Storage Management DB type is PostgreSQL.
* **STORAGE_MGMT_DB_PROVIDER**, the Storage Management DB provider. The default is SQLite. When the Storage Management DB type is PostgreSQL, the provider is Npgsql.
* **STORAGE_MGMT_DB_USER** / **STORAGE_MGMT_DB_PASSWORD**, the Storage Management DB user and password. Empty for SQLite DB. The password is automatically encrypted upon saving the config.ini.
* **TABLE_PREFIX**, the Storage Management DB table prefix. Should be populated when you want to re-use the same Storage Management DB for several implementers. For example, set TABLE_PREFIX=dev1_. Once the table prefix is set, the default tables are created in the Storage Management DB and are used each time you connect to Fabric BI. 
* **BI_REST_KEY**, a key to be used to authenticate REST requests from the Fabric server to Fabric BI. You can use the default value during the development, however it is important to update it prior to moving the project to Production. [Click to get the explanation about how to update the REST key](99_bi_admin_config.md#REST-Key). 

**Important**: the **Admin** module of **BI** has a Storage Management page which displays the default settings. These settings are not applicable in the BI solution, since Fabric retrieves the Storage Management connection details from the **config.ini**.

### Project Initialization in BI on Deploy

Upon the completion of installation and configuration setup, deploy the Fabric project. As a result, the Storage Management DB is initialized with 4 basic tables and the <project name> folder is created in the Storage Management DB metadata, with the default read-only access level.  

**Note**:

1.  Full Deploy must be performed rather than [Soft Deploy](/articles/16_deploy_fabric/01_deploy_Fabric_project.md). To deactivate Soft Deploy if it was activated in the Fabric Studio, go to the [User Preferences > Server Configuration](/articles/04_fabric_studio/04_user_preferences.html#what-is-the-purpose-of-the-server-configuration-tab) window and uncheck the Soft Deploy checkbox.
2. Storage Management DB initialization as part of Project Deploy is supported for PostgreSQL DB only. 
   * When a default SQLite DB is used without any table prefix, the initialization is not required and is skipped by Deploy.
   * When a default SQLite DB is used with a table prefix, initialize the Storage Management DB manually with the desired prefix value as described [here](99_bi_admin_config.md#storage-management-initialization), then set the TABLE_PREFIX in the config.ini to the same value and deploy your project.

Now any user accessing this project has the default read-only access to the project's reports within the Designer. It is possible to setup different access permissions per Fabric role. The [Access Permissions Setup](02_Permissions_Setup.md) article explains how to do this.
