# K2View Customized Rules

## 4.3	Cassandra

**1. Check defined Cassandra interface user/pass**  
   -*This rule checks if cassandra\cassandra user\password are being used in the studio*

   -*cassandra\cassandra must not be used as user\password in the studio interface as this is used only internally*

**2. Check host defined in Cassandra interfaces**  
   -*This rule checks if hosts are well defined in Cassandra interface*
   
      - Do not use localhost as host
      - Make sure to set all Cassandra hosts in the cluster in the interface host in order to allow high availability 

**3. Avoid allow filtering since it will trigger a full table scan**  
   -*This rule detects executing read transactions on Cassandra using allow filtering*

**4. LU Tables populated using full refresh from Cassandra**  
   -*Reload the data only if it is being used in the WS or by another table which got 
 updated.*
 
   -*Set a thread global in the WS and check this global in the root population to 
control when this occurs*
