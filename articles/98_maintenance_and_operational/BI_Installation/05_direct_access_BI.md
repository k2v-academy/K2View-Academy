# Direct Access to ExagoBI

Once the installation and configuration files update is completed, the BI application can be accessed via the **K2View Web Framework** > **BI**. 

In demo or development environments it is possible to configure the direct access to ExagoBI using the following URLs:

- Administration Console: http://[host]/Exago/Admin.aspx
- Designer: http://[host]/Exago/ExagoHome.aspx

**Note**: 

* When ExagoBI is accessed directly via the URL, the Storage Management DB connection details must be defined in the Exago Admin. Click here to learn how to [initialize the Storage Management DB](/articles/38_bi_integration/99_bi_admin_config.md#storage-management-initialization).
* The direct access to Exago Designer is disabled in the installation package since this is not a recommended way to use the BI. Click here to learn how to allow the [direct access to ExagoBI](/articles/38_bi_integration/99_bi_admin_config.md#allow-direct-access).
