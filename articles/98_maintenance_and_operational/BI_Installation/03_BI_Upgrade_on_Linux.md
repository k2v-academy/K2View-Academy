2. Download the the K2View additional files and upgrade script from [here](https://download.k2view.com/index.php/s/vESr1KlaEAewNuu) into a temporary directory.

3. Open a CLI, move to the temporary directory and extract the downloaded file by running the following command as a user with root permissions:

   ~~~bash
   tar -zxvf exago_upgrader.tar.gz
