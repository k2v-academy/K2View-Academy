# Plugin Framework

### Overview

The Plugin Framework is an internal platform for running the plugins. Each plugin is a piece of business logic that executes predefined rules in order to complement the Discovery Schema. 

The Plugin Framework runs over the Discovery Schema, created by the Crawler, and executes the plugins. A result of the plugin execution can be the creation (or removal) of various Catalog elements or properties. Each plugin calculates a score - a probability that the outcome is correct. The score is calculated per each new element or property and added to the Discovery Schema.

The Data Discovery solution includes a constantly growing list of built-in plugins. The list of active plugins and their execution order is set using the **plugins.discovery**, as described further in this article.

### Plugins Pipeline Configuration

The plugin's execution order is defined by the Plugins Pipeline configuration file called **plugins.discovery**. This file is located in the Web Studio under the **Implementation/SharedObjects/Interfaces/Discovery/** folder and can be updated per your project's needs. 

Each plugin's definition includes a threshold - the minimum score required for adding the plugin results to the Catalog. For example, if the plugin found a match with a score of 0.3 while the plugin's threshold is set to 0.7, the plugin results are dropped and will not be added to the Catalog. 

The Plugin Framework supports execution of custom plugins. In order to incorporate them into the process, these custom plugins need to be added to the Plugins Pipeline configuration file.

### Built-In Plugins

**Metadata Logical Reference**

The purpose of the *Metadata Logical Reference* plugin is to identify possible foreign key references between datasets and to create *refers to* relations. It is useful when for example a source doesn't have predefined foreign key relations. 

The matching algorithm works, each time, on comparing 2 field names of 2 different datasets. Prior to matching, formatting rules are applied in order to "normalize" the field names (e.g. remove underscore ‘_’, convert to lower-case). 

For example, the following field names can be matched:

* CUSTOMER_ID and CustomerID
* CUSTOMER.ID and CustomerID

If a match is found, the plugin estimates the link direction – per the matching rule. The matching rules determine the link direction and the foreign key fields. Some examples of the matching rules are:

<table style="width: 850px;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="150pxl">
<p><strong>Dataset 1</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="150pxl">
<p><strong>Dataset 2</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="200pxl">
<p><strong>Relation</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="200pxl">
<p><strong>Mark as FK</strong></p>
</td>
<td width="50pxl">
<p><strong>Score</strong></p>
</td>

<td width="167">
<p>Field0&nbsp; PK</p>
<p>Field1 (not PK)</p>

<td width="368">
<p><em>DS2 refers to DS1</em></p>
<p>PK table/columns: DS1 / Field1</p>
<p>FK table/columns: DS2 / Field1</p>

<td width="171">

<p>FK table/columns: DS2 / Field1, Field2</p>

<td width="210">

<p>Field3&nbsp; PK</p>
</td>
<td width="368">
<p><em>DS2 refers to DS1</em></p>
<p>PK table/columns: DS1 / Field1, Field2</p>
<p>FK table/columns: DS2 / Field1, Field2</p>
</td>
<td width="171">
<p>DS2 / Field1, Field2</p>
</td>
<td width="210">
<p>High</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Field1 is a single PK</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Field1 is a single PK</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Relation direction is random</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Low</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Field1 is not a PK</p>
</td>
<td>

</td>
<td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Eventually, the relation is created with a score - a probability that the match is correct. 

**Data Regex Classifier**

The purpose of *Data Regex Classifier* is to classify the source fields based on their **data**. Among other goals, this classification helps to identify which Catalog entities store sensitive information and should therefore be masked. 

The plugin runs on a data snapshot, extracted from the source, and executes the regular expressions defined in a built-in **data_profiling** MTable. 

If the field's data match a regex, a **Classification** property is added to the field's properties with a value such as **EMAIL**. If a match is found for more than one regex, only one property is created  - the one with higher score.

The access to the **data_profiling** MTable is available in the Web Studio using the [MTableLookup Actor](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/09_MTable_actors.md). If needed, you can modify the regular expressions by creating a **data_profiling** MTable in your project, with the same structure as the built-in MTable.

**Metadata Regex Classifier**

The purpose of *Data Regex Classifier* is to classify the source fields based on their **metadata**. 

The matching rules are defined using regular expressions in a built-in **metadata_profiling** MTable. 

If the field's data match a regex, a **Classification** property is added to the field's properties with a value such as **NAME**. If a match is found for more than one regex, only one property is created  - the one with higher score.

The access to the **metadata_profiling** MTable is available in the Web Studio using the [MTableLookup Actor](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/09_MTable_actors.md). If needed, you can modify the regular expressions by creating a **metadata_profiling** MTable in your project, with the same structure as the built-in MTable.

**Classification PII Marker**

The purpose of *Classification PII Marker* is to go over all fields which have got the **Classification** property (by either one of the above plugins)  and to add the **PII** property. 

The rules whether the classification type is defined as PII (true) or not (false) are defined in a built-in **pii_profiling** MTable. 

The access to the **pii_profiling** MTable is available in the Web Studio using the [MTableLookup Actor](/articles/19_Broadway/actors/09_MTable_actors.md). If needed, you can modify the regular expressions by creating a **pii_profiling** MTable in your project, with the same structure as the built-in MTable.

**NULL Percentage**

The purpose of this plugin is to check the % of null values per column, in the selected data snapshot.

As a result, the **Nullability Percentage** property is added to the field's properties. Its value is the % of null values and the score indicates the confidence level (size of a sample).
