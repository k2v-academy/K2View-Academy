# Fabric Catalog Overview

<web>

Today, nearly all companies are required to combine and integrate data from multiple sources, while collecting huge amounts of data on their customers, markets, suppliers, etc. Each day, more diverse sources and new data formats are added. Many of these data sources are either not well structured or do not have predefined relations. As a result, decision makers are drowning in data and yet seeking for insights. On top of that, the risks relating to data security increase, causing companies to set this issue with high priority. 

Data Discovery is a process that can help companies to cope with the above-mentioned issues. Its purpose is to:

* Keep pace with the ongoing changes and adapt to them quickly.
* Uncover and investigate hidden yet potentially useful data insights.
* Find and flag sensitive information, enabling a better protection of it.

Fabric provides a Catalog solution enabling an insight into the Fabric interfaces, starting with the RDBMS interface type. The solution's capabilities are:

* Exploring the data source's elements (schemas, objects, fields) and the links between them.
* Profiling both the metadata and data (e.g. PII identification).
* Establishing additional links between the data source elements - based on user-defined rules.
* Displaying the data catalog as a tree and enabling navigation within this tree.

The solution framework includes an infrastructure that executes various types of business rules. Among these rules are establishment of links between the schema elements, data profiling and PII identification. The baseline rules are included within the framework whereas defining additional rules is allowed.
