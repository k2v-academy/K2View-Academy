# Case Owner User Interface

A Case Owner is the role that is responsible to assure the fulfilment of the DPM requests within the established SLA. The case owner is expected to monitor the DPM Requests that are allocated to him and act if one of the Requests seems not to progress as expected. 
Every open request is automatically allocated to a specific member of the Case Owners group. This automatic allocation is configurable by the Case Owner Supervisor. For further details on the allocation configuration options, please check the Supervisor user interface.

## Case Owner Dashboard

When a member of the Case Owners group logs into the DPM system, the initial screen that is presented is the Case Owner Dashboard:

 ![image](images/Figure_46_Case_Owner_Dashboard.png)

The dashboard provides an overall status of the requests currently in process in the DPM system. Based on the information presented in this screen the case owner can identify bottlenecks in the process and evaluate risk of missed SLAs.

### Case Owner Dashboard Filters:

The graphs in the dashboard can be filtered based on a set of parameters that appear a at the upper part of the screen. The filters can be:

- Regulation – Filter the information presented in the dashboard to Requests of a specific Regulation
- Activity - Filter the information presented in the dashboard to Requests of a specific Activity
- Assigned to - Filter the information presented in the dashboard to Requests of a specific case owner or if to present the information about Requests regardless of their Case Owner.
- Aggregation by – This filter impacts the graph of “Open Requests per Selected Date Range” in the area below the filters line. It defines the time units of the horizontal Axis. If “Month” is selected, then the open requests would be aggregated per month. If “Day” is selected, then the graph will present the information per day.
- Data Range – this filter defines the date range that is used to filter the open Requests.

The selection made in those filters impacts the information presented in the totals and graphs that are presented at the lower sections of the dashboard.

### Case Owner Dashboard Totals:

The totals in the dashboard reflect the list of DPM Requests that match the selection criteria specified by the dashboard filters:

- Total Open Requests – the total number of requests which are in progress. 
- Total Past Due Requests – The total number of requests that have exceeded the expected SLA period for their Activity.
- Total Past Due Tasks – The total of tasks in progress that have exceeded the expected SLA period of the task. 

 ![image](images/Figure_46_b_Task_owner_dashboard_totals.png)

Clicking each of those totals will take the user to the “Requests List” screen, which will present the Requests that answer the conditions of this total.

### Case Owner Graphs:

- Open Requests per regulation – a view of the distribution of the open requests per Regulation.
- Open Requests Per Activity – a view of the distribution of the open requests per Regulation and Activity type.
- Open Requests per Selected Date Range – this graph shows the distribution of the open requests according to the request submission date. The blue line on the graph indicates the number of open Requests. The red line indicates how many of those requests have at least one Task that is overdue.

## Case Owner Requests List

The Case Owner Requests List presents to the Case Owner the list of Requests that are under his responsibility.

 ![image](images/Figure_47_Case_Owner_Requests_List.png)

The Request list can be filtered based on: 

- Regulation – Filter to present only Requests of a specific Regulation
- Activity - Filter to present only Requests of a specific Activity.
- Status - Filter by Request status.
- Request Risk – This filter enables the user to present only requests which are under risk of missing the overall request SLA.
- Request ID – search for a specific Request. 

The Request List table presents the following information:

## Case Owner Request Details

From the Requests List screen, the case owner can click on the row of a specific Request in order to open the Request Details Screen:

 ![image](images/Figure_48_Case_Owner_Request_Details.png)

This screen presents to the Case Owner the full view of the request, complete with all its details. 

At the upper part of the screen, general information about the Request is presented:

 ![image](images/Figure_48_a_Case_owner_Request_details_header.png)

Under the header section, the different stages that make part of the Request process are presented: 

 ![image](images/Figure_48_b_Case_owner_Request_details_Flow_stages.png)

Stages that were already completed are presented in green. The current Stage is presented in blue if it is on track, and red if it is past due. Future Stages appear in grey. 

The number of Tasks in the Stage is presented on top of every stage. If a Stage includes a Task that is overdue, then the Tasks count is presented in red.

The Case Owner can navigate between the stages by clicking on the Stage section in this chart. Navigating to one of the stages will present only the tasks that make part of the selected Stage. The view of all Tasks can be restored by clicking the “Show Tasks for All Stages” button. 

At the bottom of the screen, the list of Tasks is presented:
