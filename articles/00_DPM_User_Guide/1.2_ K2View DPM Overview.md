## 1.2  K2View DPM Overview

The Data Privacy Management module provides a company with the tools it requires to configure, manage, and audit the data subject requests which are associated with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, and many others.

K2View’s DPM is a configurable, flexible system which allows each company to define the regulations it supports, the types of requests to which it attends, procedures for fulfilling each request, and other aspects associated with compliance to the various Privacy legislations.

K2View’s DPM is composed of two main modules: 

Admin module: The Admin module is used by the DPM Administrator for the configuration of the system. Through this module the Administrator can define all Data Privacy Management aspects, such as the supported regulations, the types of requests that can be made for each regulation, the task flow required to fulfill each request, consent configuration, and more. such as the supported regulations, which type of requests can be made for each regulation, what is the task flow required for the fulfilment of each request, consent configuration, and more. 

Data subject requests and consent management: Role-based modules that serve different users, such as:

·     Call Center Representatives, who handle the submission of data requests

·     Data Stewards, who fulfill those requests

·     Case Owners, who are responsible for the successful completion of the requests under their responsibility

·     Supervisors, who control the allocation of Requests to Case Owners

These components cover the end-to-end life cycle of data privacy-related requests, from the submission of a new request, request fulfilment process, SLA management, management dashboards, and generation of audit data. In the next chapters this user guide describes in detail the functionality of each of the modules.
