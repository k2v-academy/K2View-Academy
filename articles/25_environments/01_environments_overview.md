# Environments Overview

Currently, the Web Studio does not support the Environments.

Fabric Environments are used to run the same project implementation on various data sources and parameters by switching between them according to specific needs. For example:

-  Defining environments for development. 
-  UAT testing and production. 
-  Switching between several different testing environments in the K2View TDM. 

An environment is defined by a partial or a full list of a project's [interfaces](/articles/05_DB_interfaces/01_interfaces_overview.md) together with their connection details (server, port, etc.) and must be deployed to the server. In addition, an environment can override the values in [globals](/articles/08_globals/01_globals_overview.md). Only one environment can be active at a specific time after it is selected from a predefined list of environments and switched as needed. 

An environment can be deployed either from the [Fabric Studio](/articles/25_environments/03_deploy_env_from_Fabric_Studio.md) or from the Fabric server (aka [offline environment deployment](/articles/25_environments/04_offline_deployment.md)).

Offline environment deployment can be implemented by a CI/CD process that copies an environment's configuration XML file to a predefined server's location and deploys it using a Fabric command. 

Explicit definition of the environments in a project is optional. When no environment is defined and a [Logical Unit](/articles/03_logical_units/01_LU_overview.md) is deployed to a Fabric server, all the project's interfaces are deployed together with their connection details to a default *_dev* environment. The default environment is not displayed in the Fabric Studio or in the environment's configuration XML file.

An environment can be defined on a cluster level and on a session level. Therefore a user can override an active environment per session and work on it without interacting with the changes of other users. Setting and resetting an active environment per cluster or per session is performed using the [SET environment commands](05_set_and_list_commands.md).
