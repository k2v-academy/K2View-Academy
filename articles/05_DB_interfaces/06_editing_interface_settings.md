# Editing Interface Settings

Throughout a projectâ€™s lifecycle there are a number of reasons for modifying, disabling or deleting interface settings. For example, to update an IP address or the credentials of a DB you wish to access as a data source.

<studio> 
      
2.	Double click the **interface** to open it.
</studio>
<web>

     * If the connection is OK, the **Connection is OK** notification will be displayed on the bottom of the window.

Note that for the changes to become effective for the Fabric object (for example for Web Services or an LU), deploy each object to the server separately.
