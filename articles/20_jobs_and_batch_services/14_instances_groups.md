# Instance Groups

## How Do I Create a New Instance Group?
1. Go to the **Fabric Studio**, select the **LU** > **Instance Groups** and right click and select **New Instance Group**.
2. Write a valid **SQL query** to select the instances to be included in the Instance Group.
3. Save the **Instance Group**.

The Instance Group (referred to as **customer_IG_600To700** in the screenshot above) is deployed together with its LU.

## How Do I Invoke an Instance Group from the Batch Command

Example 

    BATCH Customer.customer_IG_600To700 FABRIC_COMMAND="sync_instance CUSTOMER.?" with JOB_AFFINITY='10.21.2.102' async='true';

The Instance Group is defined from Fabric Studio - *customer_IG_600To700*

Result:

All instances with ID values between 600 and 700 are synced into Fabric.

```fabric>BATCH Customer.customer_IG_600To700 FABRIC_COMMAND="sync_instance CUSTOMER.?";```

```
