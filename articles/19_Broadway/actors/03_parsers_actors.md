# Parser Actors

Broadway has a **parsers** category of Actors. These Actors can parse input streams into different formats like JSON, CSV and XML.

When reading an input stream, the Actors can parse it into valid objects based on the specific delimiters of each input format while holding only one object in the memory at a time. This article describes these Actors and how to work with them. 

### JsonParser Actor

The **JsonParser** Actor analyzes input streams, represented by an iterable collection of blobs or strings, and returns a collection of the JSON objects found in the stream. If the **single** input attribute is set to True, the Actor expects only a single object in the input stream. Otherwise, the Actor can handle input streams with multiple JSON objects.


The **json.flow** example shows how the **JsonParser** Actor handles two types of inputs - a single JSON object and one with multiple objects.

Click **Actions** > **Examples** in the [Main menu](../18_broadway_flow_window.md#main-menu) to open the **json.flow** example.

### CsvParser Actor

The **CsvParser** Actor analyzes an input stream and returns an array of objects whereby each array row is a row of the input CSV stream. The Actor runs until it detects the end of the stream.

If the **header** input argument is set to True, the Actor uses the first row as a header row. In this case, the labels in the header are used to mark the row object.

Parser Actors are usually followed by an iteration that allow iterating over each row in the Actor's output object consecutively.

**CsvParser Flow Example**

The following example shows how to find a subscriber description by the given subscriber type. This is done by providing the subscriber type as an external input argument, then reading and parsing a CSV file which has a list of types and their description.

The parser processes the file's rows consecutively by validating the data in the **Find** Stage using the [**JavaScript** Actor's code](01_javascript_actor.md#special-keywords-and-conventions) via access to the **flowArgs** arguments and the **contextLoop** object. When the required given subscriber type is found, the iteration stops, and the flow returns the description. 

```java
if (input1.SUBSCRIBER_TYPE == flowArgs["input_subs_type"]) {
    contextLoop.stop();
    input1.SUBSCRIBER_DESC;
}
```

### XmlParser and XmlParserLegacy Actors

The **XmlParser** Actor analyzes an input stream and outputs the objects found in the stream. 

Starting with Fabric 6.5.3, there are two XMLParser Actors:

* The existing **XmlParser** Actor has been renamed to **XMLParserLegacy**. It supports parsing an XML with a list of objects only, without attributes.
* The new **XMLParser** supports parsing an XML with a list of objects that can include attributes. And example of an XML that can be parsed by **XmlParser** Actor is shown below:

~~~xml
<office name="New York">
	<user id="1" name="John" last_name="Wick">
    	<room>123</room>
        <phone_number>987654321</phone_number>
        <phone_number>123456789</phone_number>
    </user>
    <user id="2" name="Alice" last_name="Liddell">
        <room>wonderland</room>
        <phone_number>3334445555</phone_number>
        <phone_number>7776667777</phone_number>
    </user>
</office>
~~~

The enhanced functionality of the **XMLParser** Actor is that it enables setting an object name to the parsed XML elements and parsed attributes using its new input arguments **valueField** and **attributesField**.

* The input arguments **valueField** and **attributesField** have default values that can be changed or set to **null**.
* There can be four combinations of setting the input arguments  **valueField** and **attributesField**. 
  * Both **valueField** and **attributesField** have values, either the default values ('_value' and '__attributes') or the updated ones.
  * One of the arguments have a value while another one is empty.
  * Both of the arguments are empty.
* As a result of how these input arguments are set, there can be four different structures of the output object.
* When an XML includes an element with attributes and a primitive value (not a nested XML element), setting **valueField** to **null** (empty value) is not supported.

**Example of a parsed object when valueField = '_value' and attributesField = '__attributes'**

### Other Supported Parsers

Additional parser Actors supported by Broadway are:

* **Base64Decode** / **Base64Encode** Actor - analyzes an input, and outputs it as an encoded string or a decoded buffer.
* **FixedColumnParser** Actor - traverses an incoming stream, and for each line parses the columns using their fixed position in the line.
* **LinesParser** Actor - traverses an incoming stream, and outputs individual lines.

The Actor's description includes the detailed explanation of the Actor's capabilities. Click ![image](../images/99_19_dots.PNG) in the right corner of the Actor to open the [Actor's context menu](../18_broadway_flow_window.md#actors-context-menu) and select **Description** to view it.

Checkout **xml.flow** for the **XmlParser** example and **lines.flow** for the **LinesParser** example. To do so, go to **Actions** > **Examples** in the [Main menu](../18_broadway_flow_window.md#main-menu).
