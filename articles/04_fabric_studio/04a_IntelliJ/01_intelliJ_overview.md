# Coding with IntelliJ

## Overview
The Fabric platform is built with Java, and as such provides the ability to enhance your projects with any Java functions, or with 3rd party libraries from the Java
Community.   
To ensure best-of-class performance and experience, Fabric has been tightly integrated with the IntelliJ IDEA platform. 
We recommend installing IntelliJ IDE in cases where your project relies heavily on Java functions, such as for example:
- When creating a [project function]( https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/1fe6c770955eadb87cc80fd9a39af4433382d231/articles/07_table_population/10_creating_a_project_function.md#creating-a-project-function).
- When [enriching or transforming your data]( https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.5/articles/10_enrichment_function/04_enrichment_function_code_examples.md). 
- When exposing your data via Java [Web Services]( https://github.com/k2view-academy/K2View-Academy/blob/Academy_6.5/articles/15_web_services_and_graphit/06_web_services_code_examples.md#example-of-a-complex-tdm-web-service).
- When writing a new [Broadway actor](/articles/19_Broadway/28_actor_editor.md#how-do-i-create-a-new-actor-from-scratch) that implements a Java class.
