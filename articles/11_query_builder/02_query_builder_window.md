# Query Builder Window


The Query Builder window has two parts: 

* [Query](/articles/11_query_builder/02_query_builder_window.md#query-tab) -  where you can build and run an SQL query on selected DB Tables, Views or Synonyms. 
* [Results](/articles/11_query_builder/02_query_builder_window.md#result-tab) - displays the results of the executed SQL query.

### Query Tab

The Query tab enables you to build and run an SQL query on selected DB Tables and is divided into the following working areas:
1. DB Tree (top left) - enables selecting a Projectâ€™s [DB Interface](/articles/05_DB_interfaces/04_creating_a_new_database_interface.md) from the DB Interfaces dropdown list and displays a tree of DB objects (Tables, Views, and Synonyms) and their columns of the selected DB interface.
2. Main Window (top right) - displays a graphical map of the selected tables and columns for the SQL query. 
3. Selected Columns Table (bottom right) - displays the same information as the Main Window in a tabular format and enables editing the SQL query. 
4. Query Settings toolbar.
5. Query display (bottom of the window) - displays the generated SQL statement, which can be edited manually.

You can open Query Builder where Fabric is the data source. In this case, several fields will be shown at the Query Editor window top bar: Sync mode, Select LU, Instance ID. Fill in and set their values and accordingly the query will be executed.

> You can control the sizes of the Query Editor and the Results windows: Hover your mouse cursor over the horizontal separating line, which appears between these parts, and you will see the ellipsis indication; your cursor type will turn to be a cursor-resize ![cursor-resize](images/web/cursor-resize.png). Use it to resize the windows heights.
