# What is Fabric?

<a href="https://www.k2view.com/products/data-fabric/" target="_blank">Data Fabric</a> is a data management platform that provides access to data where and when you need it. 
Fabric solves real-time operational needs for data that is stored and handled in different systems, technologies or geo-locations. 

Acting as a new data layer above existing data sources, Fabric controls data using a patented Digital Entity centric approach offering multiple and diverse built-in integrated data management capabilities for end-to-end management of the data lifecycle.

### What is a Digital Entity?
A Digital Entity is a digital version of a person, place or thing and is usually correlated to a business entity like a customer, order, patient, product or household. Once implemented, Fabric creates a micro data lake physical database for each Digital Entity instance.

### Key Fabric Features
* Modern and distributed architecture that **provides linear scalability and proven fault-tolerance** on commodity hardware and cloud infrastructures.
* Data replication capabilities across nodes and datacenters that **provide customers with the peace of mind of knowing they can survive node failures or regional outages**.
* Patented Digital Entity based [MicroDB](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md#mdb--microdb), a data lake for each Digital Entity instance that **provides unparalleled performance with standard (ANSI) SQL queries**.
* Patented data security approach, every MicroDB is encrypted individually, **providing the peace of mind that massive data breaches are prevented**.
* Unique near-data-logic architecture that **enables millisecond performance and throughput for APIs**. 
* Built-in integrated drag-and-drop data management capabilities to enable a **time-to-market that is measured in days to weeks and not weeks to months**.  

To summarize, Fabric architecture yields significant savings in computing, power and storage which makes it a perfect data platform for mission-critical, operational and real-time use cases.
