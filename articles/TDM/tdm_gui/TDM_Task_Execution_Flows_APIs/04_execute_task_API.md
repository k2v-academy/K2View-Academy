# Execute Task API

### API URL

/task/{taskId}/forced/{forced}/startTask

### HTTP Method

POST

### API Category

TDM_Tasks

### API Description

Starts a task execution and return the execution's task_execution_id on success. The API can get an optional input of overriden parameters for the task execution.
The following parameters can be set:
- **entitieslist**: populated by a list of entities separated by a comma. Note that the entity list can only contain one entity ID when executing a task with a Synthetic selection method.
- **sourceEnvironmentName**: source environment name
- **targetEnvironmentName**: target environment name 
- **taskGlobals**: list of Global variables and their values. 
- **numberOfEntities**: populated by a number to change the number of entities processed by the task. This parameter is only relevant for Load tasks when the **entitylist** override parameter is not set.

The task execution is validated whether the execution parameters are overridden or taken from the task itself.

#### Validate the Task Execution Parameters

- Verify that the TDM task execution processes are up and running. If the TDM task execution processes are down, stop the task execution and return an error message.
- Test the connection details of the source and target environments of the task execution if the **forced** parameter is **false**.  
- Do not enable an execution if another execution with the same execution parameters is already running on the task.
- Validate the task's BE and LUs with the [TDM products](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/11_environment_products_tab.md) of the task execution's source and target environment.
- Verify that the user is permitted to execute the task on the task execution's source and target environment. For example, the user cannot run a [Load task](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/17_load_task_regular_mode.md) with a [sequence replacement](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/10_environment_roles_tab.md#replace-sequences) on environment X if the user does not have permissions to run such a task on this environment.

If at least one of the validations fail, the API does not start the task and returns the validation errors.

Below is the list of the validation codes, returned by the API:

- BEandLUs
- Reference
- selectionMethod
- Versioning
- ReplaceSequence
- DeleteBeforeLoad
- syncMode

#### Start the Task Execution

If the validations pass successfully, start the task execution by populating the following TDM DB tables:

- [TASK_EXECUTION_LIST](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/02_tdm_database.md#task_execution_list) - populate the source and target environments by the task execution's environments:
  - If the overriden parameters include the task execution envionments, get the execution environments from the overriden parameters. Else, get the execution environments from the [task record](/articles/TDM/tdm_gui/25_task_tdmdb_tables.md#environments-columns).
- [TASK_EXECUTION_OVERRIDE_ATTRS](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/02_tdm_database.md#task_execution_override_attrs) -  populate the JSON of the overridden parameter by param name and param value pairs. For example- "SOURCE_ENVIRONMENT": "ST1"

### API Input

- **taskId**

- **forced** -  this parameter indicates if the execution should ignore a failure of the task's environment connections validation. If the **forced** parameter is set to **true**, then the execution ignores the validation failure and executes the task. If the **forced** parameter is set to **false** and the environment validation fails, the execution is not initiated.

- An optional request body with overriden parameters for task execution. It is possible to populate all, part , or none of the overriden parameters.

  ```json
  {
    "entitieslist": "string",
    "sourceEnvironmentName": "string",
    "targetEnvironmentName": "string",
    "taskGlobals": {
      "additionalProp1": "string",
      "additionalProp2": "string",
      "additionalProp3": "string"
    },
    "numberOfEntities": 0
  }
  ```

  

### API Input Examples

#### API URL

```
http://localhost:3213/api/task/55/forced/true/startTask
```

#### Request Body Examples

##### Example 1

```json
{
	"entitieslist": "1,2,4,9,8,11",
	"sourceEnvironmentName": "SRC1",
	"targetEnvironmentName": "TAR1",
	"taskGlobals": {
	"MASKING_FLAG": "0",
	"Customer.Global2": "value2"
	"Customer.CUST_DETAILS": "'{\"name\":\"John\", \"age\":30, \"car\":null}'" 
	},
	"numberOfEntities": 14 
	
}
```

   

##### Example 2

```json
{
	"sourceEnvironmentName": "SRC1",
	"targetEnvironmentName": "TAR1",
	"taskGlobals": {
	"MASKING_FLAG": "0",
	"Customer.Global2": "value2"
	},
 "numberOfEntities": 10
}
```



### API Output Examples

#### Validation Failure Examples

```json
{
    "result":[{"Number of entity":"The number of entities exceeds the number of entities in the write permission","selectionMethod":"The User has no permissions to run the task's selection method on the task's target environment"}],
    "errorCode":"FAIL",
    "message":"validation failure"
}
```



```json
{ 
    "result": 
    [{"reference": "The user has no permissions to run tasks on Reference tables on source environment", 
      "syncMode": "the user has no permissions to ask to always sync the data from the source."    } ], 
    "errorCode": "FAIL",
    "message": "validation failure"
} 
```



#### The Test Connection of the Task's Environment Fails

The test connection runs when the **forced** input parameter is set to **false**.

```json
{"errorCode":"FAIL","message":"The test connection of [CRM_DB] failed. Please check the connection details of target environment TAR"}
```



#### Successful Execution Example

```json
{
  "result": {
    "taskExecutionId": 43
  },
  "errorCode": "SUCCESS",
  "message": null
}
```
