# Set LU Instance Per Source Environment and Version

## Overview

TDM enables users to create a [TDM task](/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/02_tdm_glossary.md#task) and select the source environment from which the entity is extracted. Tasks can also be created to extract and save different versions of the data in selected entities.

**Examples**

- Customer 1 exists in both the Production and UAT environments where different data is saved in each environment. TDM must create separate instances of Customer 1, one for Production and another for UAT.

- [Data Versioning task](/articles/TDM/tdm_overview/02_tdm_glossary.md#data-flux): A task is created to save a data version (snapshot) of Customer 1 in a testing environment and to run the task every couple of hours for backing up the data. Each version of Customer 1 must create a separate LU instance (LUI).

  

## TDM - LUI Format

To create different LUIs per environment and per version, each LUI created by the TDM must have the following format: 

### Regular Tasks

When the  Data Versioning checkbox is not set, and a separate version of the entity is not saved, the LUI format is as follows: 

```
<Source Env><separator><entity id>
```

 **Example**s:

- Copy Customer 1 from the PROD source environment. The LUI is PROD_1.
- Generate a synthetic customer. The LUI is Synthetic_12.

#### Delete Only and Reserve Only Tasks

When the TDM task either **delete only** an entity from the target environment, or **reserve only** an entity in the target environment, the target environment is concatenated to the LUI, since the source environment is not set in these tasks.

### Data Versioning Tasks

When the Data Versioning checkbox is set, that is, to save a separate version of the entity, the LUI format is as follows: 

```
<Source Env><separator><entity id><separator><version name><separator><version datetime>
```

**Example**

To extract a specific version of Customer 1 from the PROD source environment, the LUI is PROD_1_copyCust_20201105090000. 

### TDM Separator

By default, the separator between the Source Environment and the Entity ID (IID) is an underscore. This can be set to a different separator in the [TDM_GENERAL_PARAMETERS TDM DB](/articles/TDM/tdm_architecture/02_tdm_database.md#tdm_general_parameters) table. Populate the **param_name** using the **iid_separator** and the **param_value** with the separator's value.
