### The Fabric 7.1 Official Release

Fabric 7.1 has just been released and it includes the following:

* **MTable** - an object created in the Fabric memory upon the deployment, from a CSV file, to keep reference data as part of the Fabric project and to enable a **fast in-memory** data lookup at run-time.
* **Broadway** now supports physical folders, the flows can be tagged and more. In addition, a whole new set of **Data Generation** and **Masking** actors have been provided.
* Fabric now supports integration with various external **Secret Manager** providers.
