# Fabric CDC Course Overview

**Welcome to your first Fabric CDC course!**   



### Objectives

This course provides you with information about the Fabric Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanism and also discusses how to add CDC fields to your Fabric implementation. 

In addition, you will also learn about CDC consumers and Fabric's built-in integration with Elasticsearch that enables performing a cross-instance search.

### Course Syllabus

Please go to the [Level 1 CDC Training Syllabus](02_cdc_training_syllabus.md).



### Course Prerequisites 

To fully understand this course, you should be familiar with K2view Fabric.

### Course Environment

Throughout the course, we will evolve within a Telco customer management environment that provides a set of DBs and tables that you will use to operate your first Fabric-based queries and data manipulations. 

This work environment features sets of tables  like customers, subscribers, invoices and contracts that you are already familiar with. 

To work in the course environment, please install Kafka, Zookeeper and Elasticsearch on your local working station. [Click for installation instructions](/articles/demo_project/Fabric_Demo_Project/01_local_installation_of_zookeper_kafka_and_ES.md).

The CDC and Search exercises are based on the [Fabric Demo Project](/articles/demo_project) in the K2view Academy repository.


To learn more about Fabric terminology at any time during the course, you are invited to checkout the [Fabric Glossary](/articles/01_fabric_overview/02_fabric_glossary.md).


But first, letâ€™s understand more about the CDC.
